## The Bitwig Community Challenge
Bitwig Challenges are small, fun, creative monthly exercises for us to put our
skills to the test. There are no prizes and no winners. Just a bunch of geeks
making cool stuff centered  around one central theme. Create anything anything
you can imagine, whether it's a lead synth, a sound effect, a tool, or an
entire song... it doesn't matter, just make it!

## Challenge Overview
* Create and submit any sound, preset, or tool that relates to the 'Outrun' Theme.
* Submissions must be made inside of Bitwig and should end up as a '.bwpreset' file.
* Enter as many times as you'd like before the 31st of July.
* There are no winners or rankings.
* Have fun and think outside of the box.
* [join the discord](https://discord.gg/pcHDQPy) and submit content for the next challenge
